This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can filter spam and advertisement emails based on the recipient's age group: children, young adults, and adults. By analyzing the content and context of emails, the model will categorize them appropriately to ensure that users receive relevant and safe email content.
I have used a limited dataset. For more efficiency and accuracy of the model a larger dataset may be used.
